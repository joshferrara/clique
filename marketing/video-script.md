Hi, my name is Josh. I'm writing a book about friends and relationships, and I want your help.

This project has two sides to it: 

1. I want to collaborate with people like you to write a book about what makes the best people and organizations so inviting.
2. I want to make that book into a beautiful physical product that is worth reading, displaying, and sharing with others.

This Kickstarter campaign will help us accomplish both.

With your help...
