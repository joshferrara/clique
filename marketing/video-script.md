Hi, my name is Josh. I'm writing a book about friends and relationships, and I want your help.

This project has two sides to it: 

1. I want to collaborate with people like you to write a book about what makes the best people and organizations so inviting.
2. I want to make that book into a beautiful physical product that is worth reading, displaying, and sharing with others.

This Kickstarter campaign will help us accomplish both.

The money from this Kickstarter campaign will allow me to pay for professional copyediting, cover preliminary publishing setup costs, and ultimately, put a physical copy of the book in your hand.

Backers of the "Benefactor" level and higher get access to something I'm really excited about. Since the material we're discussing is all about people and relationships, I've decided to make the writing of this book a collaborative process. I'm writing the entire book using GitHub. GitHub is designed as a place where software developers like me can collaborate to write code with team members and other developers in their networks. I use the tools GitHub provides every day for work, and I think they'll be perfect to help me write a book with collaboration from people like you.
