# Intro
A look at people's first instinct when hard times hit. Who do they call first? How does your group of friends react when you have a tragedy? How do you react when a friend encounters tragedy?

# Emma Grace and the Toronto trip
One night, three months into Fraser's stay with us in Baton Rouge, he stepped out of the room to take a call from a family member back home in Toronto. We soon found out that the call was to let him know that his beautiful 15-year-old sister, Emma, had just been diagnosed with leukemia, and was set to start treatment immediately. 

When he decided to cut his time in Baton Rouge short so he could be with his family, Fraser's good friend Matty flew down from Toronto to help make the drive back to Canada.

While he was home with his family, Gabi and Katie put together a care package for Fraser's sister Emma. Things like scarves, comfy slippers, and games to occupy her time in the hospital where all boxed up and shipped to Canada with love.

Once Emma's condition was stabilized, Fraser decided to come back to Baton Rouge and finish out his original 6 month commitment. In a convenient twist of fate, Ricquel happened to be visiting her mom in Michigan right around the time Fraser was driving home, so she helped him make the drive back to Baton Rouge.

After a hard fought batter with Leukemia, Emma passed away. Immediately after hearing the news, I began to find a last minute flight to Toronto to be with Fraser and his family for what I imagined would be a tough week. 

Fraser is not someone that I grew up with. He's not am old family friend. We're not even related! In fact, our first introduction happened through a friend of a friend situation!

Why we're we such close friends? Because of that x-factor that draws people together.
