In life, there seem to be 2 groups of friends: 
- **A-list friends**
  - These are the friends that give. Time with them fills you up. You look forward to hanging out. You can depend on and trust in them.
- **B-list friends**
  - These are the friends that take. Time with them empties you. It's sometimes work to hang out. You aren't sure if you can depend on or trust in them.
  
While we'd obviously prefer to spend time with A-listers, the truth is that B-list comprises the majority of the people in your life. They aren't bad people, they just aren't A-list friends. Maybe they don't always respond to your texts right away, maybe they're just a little insecure when hanging out with a group, or maybe they're the friend that doesn't always pay for their share of dinner.

The important thing, though, is that you leave room for the B-listers. Those are the people you're here to help.

A couple thoughts:
- People can move back and forth between A-list and B-list. That's ok.
- Remember, you are on someone's B-list. That's ok, too.
- Identifying where a friend falls is important for adjusting your expectations. Don't expect A-list behavior from a B-list friend; you'll always be disappointed.
- Lists are seasonal. You and your friends change, and everyone moves around from A to B sometimes.
