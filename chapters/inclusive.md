Our group of friends is not exclusive. We include people you may not expect, and it has a profound impact on our group. 

- beach trip (Andy)
- watching TWD
- football games at Sandy's 
- team lunches

On the other hand, we're really protective of certain periods of down time, because you sometimes you just need "family time".

- post hangs at the lairds
- SSS party
- lunch after church
- super bowl parties
