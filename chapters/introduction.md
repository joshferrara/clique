This will be the very first chapter of the book, and will hopefully set the tone for what the book is about and what to expect while reading it.

Ideally this would be the first thing finished to help set a pattern for the rest of the writing.

# About Me
To help you understand my personal context in my friend groups, it's probably helpful to understand how I fit in the stories you're about to read. 

I'm pretty sure most of my friends wouldn't call me the life of a party, I'm not usually the loudest (or tallest) guy in the room, and I generally can't stand surface conversations like discussing the weather. I'm typically wrapped up in a conversation with one or a few people, I enjoy including people that are new to the group (likely because I've been that guy quite a few times) and I'm usually the person that asks tough questions like "What are your top three regrets from this past year?"

My close friends get frustrated with me when we're trying to walk through a crowd because I'm a conversation guy. I like to try my best to give people my full attention when I'm talking, so I'm not the best at cutting off conversations and moving on. If there is a crowd of people lingering after a party, I'm probably somewhere in there, and my wife is probably standing somewhere near the door waiting for me to finish talking to each person I run into on the way to the car. 

# About This Book
My favorite part about this book is the story of how it came to be. From a conversation over coffee with my friend Brandon, to a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds, to using GitHub to write the book collaboratively with some brilliant people, this book is living proof of itself. This book wouldn't exist if the concepts inside of it weren't true. 

# Let's Go
Before we get started, it's important that you know all of the names in this book have been preserved to protect the reality of the points I'm trying to make. If you know me, it's likely that you'll recognize a few of the names and stories you're about to read. If you don't know me, you're more than welcome to befriend my friends on Facebook; you'll quickly start to see that these stories couldn't be more real. 

Being the kind of person you'd hang out with isn't difficult, and this book is full of real stories about doing just that.
