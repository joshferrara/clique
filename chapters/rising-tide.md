Along the idea that `a rising tide lifts all boats`, the successes and opportunities of one person within a healthy group is often felt as a positive outcome for the whole group. Better, arguably, is the idea that as the tide rises, you have no choice but to raise your standards. 

In my group of friends, it would stick out like a sore thumb if I was uncommitted to my job, slept all day, and didn't have much drive. There are plenty of people that I could hang around and not feel any tension from acting apathetic or lazy, but because the tide has risen in my group of friends, I'm held accountable to a higher standard of living.
