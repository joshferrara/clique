## The Idea

I'm writing a book and I want your help. 

To get the full story, visit [projectclique.com](http://projectclique.com).

## Quick Start Guide

The entire writing process for this book is going to happen right here, on GitHub, a site that enables collaborative writing. While it was originally intended for writing code, GitHub has many features that will be useful in the process of writing this book and working together to make it something worth reading.

### Chapters

In the [file browser](http://github.com/joshferrara/clique#slider) above you'll find a folder called `Chapters`, which contains all of the current chapters in progress. Clicking a chapter lets you view the work in progress. If you have changes you'd like to make while viewing a file, clicking the `Edit` button will "fork" the project. Forking simply a way of creating a copy of the project for you to edit without interferring with the original version. Once you've made your edits, just follow the instructions, `Propose File Changes`, and then submit a `Pull Request` which will let me see the changes you've suggested and merge them into the main project.

It may sound a little complicated, but if you follow the instructions at each step it's pretty straight-forward. 

### Issues

The [Issues](https://github.com/joshferrara/clique/issues) tab is where ideas can be discussed, new topics proposed, and it's also where a running list of todos for the project lives. 

Each `Issue` is a ongoing discussion, so feel free to chime in and offer your thoughts on any issues that spark your interest.

## Confused?

If you're like me, this is the first time you've been a part of anything like this. We're figuring it out together as we go, so if you have any questions or ideas that you'd rather send directly to me, feel free to send me an email: <joshferrara@gmail.com>
